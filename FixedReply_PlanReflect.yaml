  Consider the problem statement and the last proposed solution. Are you sure that the solution is provided in the requested format, and crucially, solves the problem?
  If that is not the case, provide the corrected version of the conceptual solution in the following format:
  # Conceptual solution
  {{conceptual_solution}}
  otherwise, reply:
  "Final answer."
