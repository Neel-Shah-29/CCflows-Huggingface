This repository is part of the [FlowVerse](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/aiflows) and contains the competitive coding Flows used in the experimental setup (implemented [here](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/cc_flows)) for the paper [Flows: Building Blocks of Reasoning and Collaborating AI](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/cc_flows/blob/main/assets/flows_paper.pdf) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01285">arXiv</a>).

The implelemented Flows are illustrated in the figure below:
